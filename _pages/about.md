<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am Boyuan An, an undergraduate student in Robotics Engineering (Honors Program) at [ZheJiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), expected to graduate in 2027. Currently, I am a research intern at the [AI4CE Lab](https://ai4ce.github.io/), [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/), working with [Institute Associate Professor Chen Feng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YeG8ZM0AAAAJ&hl=en). Before that, I was fortunate to intern at [ZJU FAST LAB](https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab), advised by [Prof. Fei Gao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4RObDv0AAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests include reinforcement learning, computer vision, and autonomous robotic systems.
